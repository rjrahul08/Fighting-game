   - **L**: Heal - Press the **L** key to make Player 2 heal. Healing restores a random amount of health between 1 and 5.

3. **Simulate Button**: Click the **Simulate** button to let the AI control both players and watch them fight automatically.

4. **Reset Button**: After a match is over, click the **Reset** button to start a new battle with both players' health restored to 100.

### Winning the Game
